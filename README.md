Howdy, I'm Rae! The transfem wizrd! (not wizard)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-I'm interested in programming (obviously), art, and I'm getting into composing music!

-I've mostly got experience in C#, only having a little in C++. At the moment, I do all of the programming in unity,
  but I hope to move to other things such as Gamemaker in the future, or anything. Just anything.
  
-I'd love to collaborate on any projects I would be interested in! It helps with experience, and gets me better with doing stuff.

-You can reach me via Discord! Not much else right now. My user is raethewizrd.

-My pronouns are She/Her


-Fun Fact: I am also a very, very huge Pizza Tower fan. You'll probably see me on plenty of stuff related to that.
